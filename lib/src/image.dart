  /// middle of the bottom edge of its layout bounds.

  /// If the [alignment] is [TextDirection]-dependent (i.e. if it is a
  /// [AlignmentDirectional]), then an ambient [Directionality] widget
  /// must be in scope.

  /// drawn with its origin in the top left (the "normal" painting direction for
  /// images); and in [TextDirection.rtl] contexts, the image will be drawn with
  /// a scaling factor of -1 in the horizontal direction so that the origin is
  /// in the top right.
  ///
  /// This is occasionally used with images in right-to-left environments, for
  /// images that were designed for left-to-right locales. Be careful, when
  /// using this, to not flip images with integral shadows, text, or other
  /// effects that will look incorrect when flipped.
